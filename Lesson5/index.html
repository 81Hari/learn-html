                1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database 
                MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).
                
                Why use MongoDB? 
                
                Fast – Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.
                Scalability – Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
                Use of JavaScript – MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.
                Schema Less – Any type of data in a separate document.
                Data stored in the form of JSON –
                Objects, Object Members, Arrays, Values, and Strings
                JSON syntax is very easy to use.
                JSON has a wide range of browser compatibility.
                Sharing Data: Data of any size and type(video, audio) can be shared easily.
                Simple Environment Setup – Its really simple to set up MongoDB.
                Flexible Document Model – MongoDB supports document-model(tables, schemas, columns & SQL) which is faster and easier.
                Creating a database: Simply done using a “use” command: </p>

            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt>HTML</dt>
                <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

                    So what is HTML?
                    HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</dd>
                
                
            </dl>
        </section> 
    
        <hr>
        
        <section id="css">
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <dl>
            <dt>CSS</dt>
                <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

                    What is CSS?
                    Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</dd>

            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt>JavaScript</dt>
                <dd>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

                    JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
                    
                    JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
                    
                    Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
                    Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
                    Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
                    It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.
                    
                    The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!</dd>
